  The Dutch and Amsterdam based E-bike manufacturer VanMooF requested INFO's help with a proof of concept of a repair ticketing application. In the end the development went on to have the Fixer application used by all involved bike doctors, and the hiring lasted not a couple months, but over 1.5 year. And Sidney could not be missed and as one the very few even survived letting go of all contractors!

  On a previous farewell Sidney received a pair of preprinted socks. One of the many Sidney-farewells by the way! The Wiki goodbye page was titled 'Hero on socks'. Let's keep the spirit today, and for this occasion call Sidney our: 'Hero on wheels'!
